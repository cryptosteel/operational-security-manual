On Operational Security and the Cryptosteel Capsule - The Anatomy of the Cryptosteel Capsule

The more complex the digital environment I live in becomes, the more important it is to use a simple physical starting point that I can possess and, based on which, all of my digital wealth can be proven and accessed.

This is just a sample of some questions and thoughts one might have nowadays when thinking about digital wealth and virtual presence. Below, you will see the hows and whys of storing private information with the Cryptosteel Capsule and achieving peace of mind.

Upgrading my security
The more valuable the information, the higher the level of security required to protect it, the higher the cost of that protection.
This also means that any aggressor’s investment must be higher to break the protection. 
Therefore, the questions to answer first should be: What is the value of my information? 
What level of security does the Capsule itself provide and can I improve it by additional means if necessary? 
Think through the whole process of using your sensitive private information. The security of any solution depends heavily on the particular implementation. The Capsule was mainly designed to store information for backup cases; however, it is a universal tool and can be applied in various scenarios. 

What The Capsule Offers
How To Improve It
Confidentiality (privacy) - no one can get to my information and misuse it
Completely offline storage, no 3rd party involvement, 
information hidden inside the Capsule

Secret sharing - using more than one Capsule in different locations, 
all operations done in a private environment, 
encryption of the stored information

Integrity - no one can change the information without my knowledge
Tiles attached to the core, fastener usage
DIY tamper evidence seal
Availability - I can get the stored information whenever I need it and it will be usable
Durable construction (Fireproof up to 1400C/2500F. Shockproof. Waterproof. Stainless. Perennial.) 
Protection against theft - secure storage:
masked in a wall, 
buried in the ground, 
kept in a vault...
Poor password choices
Think of your password as the magical phrase that opens the cave to all your treasures. Would you use something obvious like “open sesame” that anybody can guess? Or a long, unique phrase that’s too complicated to remember so you write it down and store it somewhere close to the cave? Any security system is only as strong as its weakest part.

With a proper backup tool like the Capsule, there is no need for a trade-off between password strength and memorability.

Don’t compromise on password or key length. To protect a highly valuable digital asset, one needs a high-quality password (unique, long enough, and difficult to guess - random, using various strings like uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), a safe tool to store it (Cryptosteel), and a secure procedure to handle it. 
Good password features
These are the requirements for creating a strong password:

Feature
Requirements
Uniqueness
Key/password should be used for one purpose only 
Should not be obvious or based on common words or sequences, a replacement scheme, or a single dictionary word

Length
The minimum length depends on the application of the key or password. Always follow the suggestions given by the provider of the related service or check general suggestions for the applied algorithm
The longer the better 

Randomness
Use various types of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters) in a random combination 
If possible, use a password generator including a reliable source of entropy such as a true random number generator 
Bad practices
Identical passwords reused for different sites (like one PIN used for several credit cards).
Easy to guess passwords (like Peter123 or P@ssw0rd).
Good practices 
We recommend using mnemonics (e.g. BIP39), which is the best method for human to computer interaction compared to handling raw binary or hexadecimal password representations.
Don’t share your password with anyone. Keep your secret offline. Don’t take pictures of it, especially with your smartphone. 
A feature of the Capsule is that once your password is on the core, neither you nor anyone else can accidentally reveal it or take a picture of it. 
With the Capsule, you are able to store 512-bit keys or even more complex codes. In combination with modern cryptographic algorithms, it provides you with state-of-the-art security for your digital assets. 

Shamir's Secret Sharing
Shamir’s secret-sharing provides a better mechanism for backing up secrets by distributing custodianship among a number of locations or trusted parties in a manner that can prevent loss even if one or a few of those parties become compromised or lost. The scheme allows you to split your recovery seed backup into multiple independent parts called shares.
Cryptosteel Capsules have been boxed together to support the Shamir Backup secret-sharing scheme as implemented by SatoshiLabs in the SLIP-39 standard. The sets “TRIO” and “QUINTET” can be used to store a master seed using the 2-of-3 and 3-of-5 schemes, respectively, and multiple sets can be used for up to x-of-16.

Featured attributes
Durable - the main purpose of the Capsule is to provide the availability of the stored information. No matter how long it has been stored, or what hostile conditions the tool has been kept in, the information will be available in the original form and able to be read [A]
Tangible - cannot be randomly changed, keeps the integrity of the form and format for a very long time, and there is more common knowledge of how to protect tangible items (e.g. gold, cash, etc.) in comparison to digital ones [I]
Offline - in order to achieve confidentiality of the stored information, at no moment should the full information be available in an uncontrolled environment (cloud storage, mobile app, etc.) [C]

The Capsule fits perfectly within the AIC Triad, which is a template for information security strategy.
Additional security features
The Capsule is a universal backup tool, and it’s up to the user to decide what level of protection they need. The main security feature provided by the Capsule is the availability of the stored information. Depending on the type of information stored, additional security features may be required. 
Example: Having stored a backup copy of the private key for signature, one needs to know if an outside agent has read the key while it was stored in the Capsule, and in the case of a compromised private key, revoke the related public key. 
It’s possible to put a DIY tamper-evident seal on the Capsule. Depending on your needs, you can add paint, nail polish, sealant, a special envelope, etc. You can also weld it closed to create a fireproof barrier seal. 
You can create fireproof identification labels with the provided tiles. Place a wire through the cap hole, bend a tile in half with a hand tool, thread it on the wire, and clamp it tight. 
For those using a hardware wallet, most producers recommend adding a passphrase to the seed. Please read the manufacturer's instructions on how to add one. If you want to make a physical backup of your passphrase, do not store it next to the backup of your seed. Use another Capsule stored in a different location. 

Storability
The Capsule is a solid metal device that has been designed to survive extreme conditions and to last for several lifetimes. It is resistant to crushing, compression, and corrosion. It’s waterproof, fireproof, and shockproof. That, along with its small size, means that its ability to be stored or hidden is only limited to your requirements and imagination.
Use cases
Cold storage for hardware wallet recovery seed backup (BIP-39, if abbreviated - use only the first four letters of each word)
Secret sharing (SLIP-39 Shamir backup in abbreviated form, use the first four letters of each word)
Private keys for public-key algorithms for digital signature (ECDSA, base64 encoded)
Secret keys for symmetric algorithms for encryption (AES, base64 encoded)
Passphrase backup for password managers

GPGR = with great power comes great responsibility
You maintain full possession and control of your data. There is no way to recover your lost backup. It is up to you to protect your backup and remember to always keep the fastener on the core. 
SPOF = single point of failure 
In decentralized systems, there is no main authority who may revoke or restore your passwords. If you lose your key, there is no way to get it back.
If one part of a system failing causes the entire system to stop, that is known as a single point of failure. Redundant copies and Secret Sharing Schemes are the solution for this. 
Socrates said “Know Thyself”
Acknowledge your limitations. The Capsule provides standardization for Offline Backup Solutions. Unless you are a tremendously skilled professional, please take our advice and avoid creating an untested or undocumented cryptosystem that could lock you or your relatives out of your own money.

SHELL
2.3mm thickness - engineered as a barrel from a solid AISI303 steel bar.
It provides defense against water, fire, deformation, pressure, shock, vandalism, abuse, time.

CORE
Stainless AISI304 with the Cryptosteel logo - stamped, not welded, into the cap for additional safety.
Holds the organized tiles. The core is designed to be longer than needed in order to hold the full number of tiles and have room to slide them to read your backup.

FASTENER
Toolless. 
Keeps the tiles on the core. 
Please keep the fastener locked when reading the stored information, otherwise, you risk mixing the tiles and losing your information. It should be removed only in rare cases when you need to change the tiles on the core.

SLOT 
Opening for the fastener.
The long slot allows for movement of the fastener on the core, which helps to absorb pressure or shock. Always remember to lock the core with a fastener in the slot once you have finished placing the tiles.

SEQUENCE 
The information stored in the Capsule can be formatted in groups of words segmented by separators or as a plain string of characters. There is space for up to 123 tiles. Before putting the sequence together, there are a few things you need to determine. 

Q: Do I need to abbreviate my seed?
A: If you are using a 12-word recovery seed, spell out the entire word. If your Recovery Seed is longer - prepare an abbreviation by using only the first four letters of each word. Detailed video instructions are available on our official webpage.

Q: In which direction should the sequence be placed on the core?
A: We recommend organizing the tiles in order so that the first character of the sequence is placed first, closest to the cap. You will read from the cap to the fastener slot, or from left to right. 

Q: Which side of the two-sided tile should be read?
A: Read the tiles the way they were placed on the core. We recommend putting them face up, which would then be the side facing the fastener. 

CAP
DIY fireproof tamper-evident capabilities.
Twist the cap securely in order to protect the core of the Capsule against water, fire, or other external hostile forces. If needed, a DIY tamper-evident seal on the cap may be added.

CAP HOLE
Outer hole for mounting/holder/identification.
The cap hole allows attaching a DIY fireproof identification label or holder to the Capsule.

THREAD
Hermetic thread.
Protects the core against water, fire, or other external hostile forces.

TILES
Uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (ASCII).
Two-sided tiles with deeply pressed letters: uppercase (A-Z), lowercase (a-z), numbers (0-9) and symbols (!#$%&()*+,-./:;<>=?@[\]^_`{|}~“). You use the tiles to create the sequence you want to store inside the Capsule. They can also be used as fireproof identification labels.

INDENTS
Aesthetics, grip, fingerprint-free.
Make the Capsule a highly practical, yet aesthetic, tool for the backup of sensitive information.

SEPARATORS
Special purpose tiles to segment the information on the core.
Used to divide abbreviated or plain words on the core, and organize the information stored in the Capsule.
Easily identifiable both visually and tactilely, and made for easy searching.

### CRYPTOSTEEL PRIVACY GUIDE EXPLAINED BY WASABI

**MY PRIVACY, BITCOIN AND ME**

In the digital age, privacy is hard. Privacy is a choice about what information to share about yourself. As an open monetary network, all bitcoin transactions are publicly visible to all. Maintaining financial privacy on bitcoin can be hard, but you can protect it using the right wallet. 

**PRIVACY = SECURITY**

You should generate your seed on a bitcoin wallet that does not leak personal information. A bitcoin wallet should be free and open source, with as many reviews from developers and users as possible. It should handle balance queries in a private way, without leaking your addresses and transaction history to third parties. Your wallet should also be integrated with an anonymity network such as Tor, which protects your IP address from being collected.

We recommend using Wasabi Wallet. It is compatible with most hardware devices and has a built-in coinjoin feature. A coinjoin is a collaborative bitcoin transaction to hide your transaction history from the public and reclaim your privacy on bitcoin.
